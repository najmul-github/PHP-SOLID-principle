## Installation Guide
- Make sure you have PHP 8.1+ and MySQL/MariaDB installed.
- Run `composer install`.
- Update the `config/database.php` file based on your database credentials.

- Run the project: `php index.php`.

## Requirements
- Replace the existing `get()` function following OOP best practices.
- Focus on SOLID principles.
- You may need to update/modify the query. The current query is there for example purpose only.

### Bonus (Optional)
- Write tests.
- Implement error handling where applicable.
